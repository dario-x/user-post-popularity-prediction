# Paper Abstract
In the contemporary digital communication landscape, the influence wielded by news agencies, users, and even bots is undeniable. Their ability to shape public opinion, drive agendas, and potentially sway elections has sparked interest in understanding the factors governing post popularity. While previous research on post popularity prediction has predominantly focused on platforms like Twitter, this thesis ventures into uncharted territory by analyzing the One Million Posts Corpus, sourced from the Austrian daily newspaper 'Der Standard'. By delving into this dataset, which represents a unique demographic and content context, this study aims to unravel the details of post-engagement dynamics and showcase the underlying mechanisms that lead to popularity trends.
